# Reading Data

auto <- read.csv("Automobile.csv",header = TRUE,sep = ",")
```
#Using the str() function to get a feel for the dataset. This function allows you to get the dimensions of the dataset and also helps you glance through the names, types and a few observations of variables from the dataset
```{r}

```
##Take a look at the data using the "head()" and "tail()" functions
```{r}
head(auto)
tail(auto)
```
#using the summary() function to get descriptive statistics of all the numerical variables in the dataset, for categorical variables it gives the frequencies of the different levels

train_rows <- sample(x = 1:nrow(auto_numeric), size = 0.7*nrow(auto_numeric))
train <- auto_numeric[train_rows,]
test <- auto_numeric[-train_rows,]
```
# Standardizing the Data
#We will use the Caret pakcage to standardize the data after the split using the __"preProcess()"__ function
#It saves the metrics such as mean and standard deviation used for calculating the standardized value by creating a model object
#* We can then use the model object in the __"predict()"__ function to standardize any other unseen dataset with the same distribuiton and variables
```{r}
library(caret)
# The "preProcess()" function creates a model object required for standardizing unseen data

# Do not standardize the target variable

std_model <- preProcess(train[, !names(train) %in% c("price")], method = c("center", "scale"))

# The predict() function is used to standardize any other unseen data
train[, !names(train) %in% c("price")] <- predict(object = std_model, newdata = train[, !names(train) %in% c("price")])
test[, !names(train) %in% c("price")] <- predict(object = std_model, newdata = test[, !names(train) %in% c("price")])

# Modelling the Data

## Basic Model

###Multiple Regression Model

### Stepwise Elimination
```{r}
fit1 <- lm(formula = price~hoesepower+city_mpg+peak_rpm+curb_weight+engine_size,data = train)
summary(fit1)

plot(fit1)

#R^2 = 82.19

```
# Checking for non-linearity properly 
# This can be done after the model is created
```{r}
library(corrplot)
library(car)
crPlots(fit1)

#Component residual plots, an extension of partial residual plots, are a good way to see if the predictors have a linear relationship to the dependent variable. A partial residual plot essentially attempts to model the residuals of one predictor against the dependent variable. A component residual plot adds a line indicating where the line of best fit lies. A significant difference between the residual line and the component line indicates that the predictor does not have a linear relationship with the dependent variable
```
#Eliminate Extreme Values / Outliers
# Cooks D-plot cutoff as 4/(n-k-1)
```{r}
cutoff <- 4/((nrow(train)-length(fit1$coefficients)-2))
plot(fit1,which = 4,cook.levels = cutoff)
plot(fit1,which = 5,cook.levels = cutoff)

# Now to eliminate the training outlier samples
train <- train[-which(rownames(train)%in%c("75","50","128")),]


```
# Refit the model 
```{r}
fit2<- lm(formula = price~hoesepower+city_mpg+peak_rpm+curb_weight+engine_size,data = train)
summary(fit2)
```

```{r}
cutoff <- 4/((nrow(train)-length(fit2$coefficients)-2))
plot(fit2,which = 4,cook.levels = cutoff)
plot(fit2,which = 5,cook.levels = cutoff)

# Now to eliminate the training outlier samples
train <- train[-which(rownames(train)%in%c("17","127","19")),]
```
# Refit Model
```{r}
fit3<- lm(formula = price~hoesepower+city_mpg+peak_rpm+curb_weight+engine_size,data = train)
summary(fit3)
```

```{r}
cutoff <- 4/((nrow(train)-length(fit3$coefficients)-2))
plot(fit3,which = 4,cook.levels = cutoff)
plot(fit3,which = 5,cook.levels = cutoff)

# Now to eliminate the training outlier samples
train <- train[-which(rownames(train)%in%c("18","59","31")),]

```
## Best Choosen Model 
```{r}
fit4<- lm(formula = price~hoesepower+city_mpg+peak_rpm+curb_weight+engine_size,data = train)
summary(fit4)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(fit4)

# R^2 = 81.56
```
# Evaluating Final Linear Model

```{r}
preds_model <- predict(fit4, test[, !(names(test) %in% c("price"))])

regr.eval(preds_model,test$price)
```
The final formula for the chosen regression model is:

$$Price = 13079.9 - 723\times (HP)-674.1\times(city_mpg)+857.4\times(peak_rpm)+3208.6\times(curb_weight)+4293.7\times(enginesize)$$

You can also embed plots, for example:


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
